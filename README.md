# Golang Training Resources

This repository contains files needed for managing Go language workshop - it's some kind of quite complete walk-through of Go language. Feel free to look on the code, there are many comments which could be useful for beginners and semi-intermediate Go developers.

## About Go

Who designed Go language?

- Rob Pike (Unix, UTF-8)
- Ken Thompson (Unix author, UTF-8, B lang)
- Robert Griesemer (V8, Java Hotspot (Oracle Java), GFS)

but those above are only ignitors of whole contributions: https://golang.org/AUTHORS

Why `go` was developed by Google? They have a lot of problems in C/Python/Java codebases:

- speed up development
- speed up compiling
- multicore systems

sources:
- https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_is_the_purpose_of_the_project
- https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article


## Go language characteristics

- statically compiled (one fat binary with all dependencies)
- Garbage Collected
- Strong types
- Functions as first class citizens
- Object Oriented (but without inheritance and classes)

## Why it's worth of your time?

- easy deployment (no dependencies, single binary statically linked)
- no more code style wars - `gofmt`
- integrated package downloader `go get`
- integrated code validation `go vet` and `golint` (github.com/golang/lint)
- nice playground (https://play.golang.org/)
- `gocode` intellisense server - you don't need fat IDE to write go code, you can use now editor which you love (Sublime, Atom, Vim, Emacs, VSCode)
- very fast compilation - if you're going from JAVA world you'll be really surprised
- quite complete standard library - template/html, performant www servers, json, xml, streams, io, buffers, first class citizen concurrency
- easy to use cross-compilation (x64, ARM, 386, Mac, Windows)
- easy start, bunch of editors, all things simply work
- http2 in core
- testing included
- benchmarking of code included
- very low entry barrier
- hype, one of fastest growing language, many new projects are in Go recently
- concurrency
- great documentation generator
- and many many more ...

## Workshop prerequisites

You can install `golang` and `docker` using your preferred way i.e. your OS package manager (brew, pacman, apt, snap or other) or you can simply follow installation instruction on go and docker sites.

### Golang installation

For recent installation instructions please refer to [Golang installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)

You'll need `git` to be installed

### Docker install

> Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.



For recent docker installation please follow [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your OS.

Docker is needed for some parts of workshops for running databases or other needed dependencies. Also will be needed to complete homework.

### Docker Compose Installation

> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

To install docker compose please follow [Docker compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Init workshops to play on your machine with code

    go get github.com/exu/go-workshops
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/exu/go-workshops

## Go Tools

### Included

- go test - included testing framework
- go fmt - code formater - only one valid coding standard -  [fmt library website](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/)

- go oracle - dependencies analyser (can be integrated in editor) [oracle web site](http://golang.org/s/oracle-user-manual)
- godoc - great documentation generator and viewer
- gocode - autocomplete service - [gocode library website](https://github.com/mdempsky/gocode)

### IDEs

- IntelliJ Go plugin https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9568-go
- GoLand - https://www.jetbrains.com/go/
- Emacs - go-mode
- Vim - vim-go
- Visual Studio Code (really great UX)
- LiteIDE
- SublimeText
- Atom

### Auto reload

- BRA (Brilliant Ridiculous Assistant) https://github.com/Unknwon/bra - it's good to setup it when you're working on some webservers to auto reload your app when changes in code are made.


## Github style - project structure

In go, idiomatic way is to organise code in "github style", so part of the path is looking like server address to library. Of course if you want you don't need to do this, but whole ecosystem works that way.

```sh
src/
    github.com
        exu
            mysuperproject
    ioki.com.pl
            mnmel
                 nmelinium
bin/
    superappbinary
pkg/
    compiled packages
```

Environment variable `$GOPATH` is responsible for path to the root dir of `src`, `bin` and `pkg` directories.


## Packages and Importing

`package` in go is in form of files with directive `package package_name` on top of each file. Package by default is imported as full path to package.

    import "github.com/exu/go-workshops/010-basics-importing/sub"

## Getting and installing external packages

To get external package we need to run go install which will get sources and binaries and put them to `src`/`bin`/`pkg` directories

```sh
go install external.package.com/uri/to/package
```

## `sub` example package

As we can see our `sub` package is in directory `sub` (obvious) and have two files; `sub1.go` and `sub2.go` each of them also have `package sub` directive which tells compiler that they are in one package.



([code for: Basics Importing](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/010-basics-importing))

## Package managers

Currently most advanced in go ecosystem is `gomod` https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules

You can init your project:

	$ go mod init myapp
	$ ls
	go.mod go.sum

([code for: Package Management](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/011-package-management))

## Modules

Modules are quite new in Go (begins in 1.11 as experimental feature)
in `1.12` they are in auto mode what means that if you are in GOPATH
they will be disabled and when you'll be out of GOPATH they will be enabled

In incoming 1.13 version modules will be enabled by default which means that
no more github style code organisation will be needed


### Commands

0. Check `echo $GO111MODULE` first - if value is `off` or `auto` you need to set it to `on`
1. `go mod init` initialize modules in project directory
2. `go mod tidy` cleans your unused modules
3. `go mod download` downloads modules to cache
4. `go mod vendor` vendoring modules from cache

5. `go build`, `go test`, `go run` downloads modules automatically so you don't need to do it
6. `go run -mod vendor` using vedored modules

### Tools

As in middle 2019 editors have still issues with new modules, you need
to install proper `gocode` or can use `gopls` (language server) for
autocompletition



([code for: Modules](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/012-modules))

## Variables

In go variables can be declared and assigned in one simple way `a := 1`, compiler will detect type of variable based on its value.



([code for: Basics Variables](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/020-basics-variables))

## Constants

Use `const` to define new constant, mechanics looks like in other languages. What is worth to mention that we have `iota` keyword which could be used as some kind of iterator in constant definition.



([code for: Basics Constants](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/030-basics-constants))

## Funkcje

Functions in Go are "First class citizen".

- function definition
- multiple returns
- named multiple returns
- deferred calls
- variadic functions


([code for: Basics Functions](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/040-basics-functions))

## Packages initialisation

`func init() {}` is responsible for package initialisation, it's called only once when import statement for given package is called.



([code for: Basics Init](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/041-basics-init))

## Closures aka anonymous functions

Go supports anonymous functions, which can form closures. Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it.

Functions in Go are first class citizens so it can be:
- passed as parameters
- created as types
- assigned as values to variables
- called anonymously
 


([code for: Basics Closures](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/042-basics-closures))

## Data structures: Arrays

In Go, an `array` is a **numbered sequence of elements** of a specific
length. Arrays are "low level" data structures with slices over them
which simplifies creating and managing.



([code for: Basics Arrays](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/050-basics-arrays))

## Slices


Slices are a key data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays.

Unlike arrays, slices are typed only by the elements they contain (not the number of elements). To create an empty slice with non-zero length, use the builtin make. Here we make a slice of strings of length 3 (initially zero-valued).

sources:

- https://blog.golang.org/slices
- https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SliceTricks
- https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals
- http://research.swtch.com/godata
- http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals
- http://www.dotnetperls.com/slice-go



([code for: Basics Slices](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/051-basics-slices))

## Loops

In go there is only one loop keyword: `for`. It's often used with `range` keyword to iterate over array like elements.


([code for: Basics Loops](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/052-basics-loops))

## Data structures: Maps

One of the most useful data structures in computer science is the hash table. Many hash table implementations exist with varying properties, but in general they offer fast lookups, adds, and deletes. Go provides a built-in map type that implements a hash table.



([code for: Basics Maps](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/055-basics-maps))

## Basics Overriding Internal Types



There is no README.md for Basics Overriding Internal Types use ([code for: Basics Overriding Internal Types](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/057-basics-overriding-internal-types)) link to follow code examples



## `make` and `new` keywords

`new(T)` allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type T and returns its address. In Go terminology, it returns a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of type T.

`make(T)` For slices, maps, and channels, make initializes the internal data structure and prepares the value for use.

### `make`

Things you can do with make that you can't do any other way:

- Create a channel
- Create a map with space preallocated
- Create a slice with space preallocated or with len != cap


### `new`

It's a little harder to justify new. The main thing it makes easier is creating pointers to non-composite types. The two functions below are equivalent. One's just a little more concise:

    func newInt1() *int { return new(int) }

    func newInt2() *int {
        var i int
        return &i
    }


Go has multiple ways of memory allocation and value initialization:

    &T{...}, &someLocalVar, new, make

Allocation can also happen when creating composite literals.

new can be used to allocate values such as integers, &int is illegal:

    new(Point)
    &Point{}      // OK
    &Point{2, 3}  // Combines allocation and initialization

    new(int)
    &int          // Illegal

    // Works, but it is less convenient to write than new(int)
    var i int
    &i

In terms of channels there you can use make and new

    p := new(chan int)   // p has type: *chan int
    c := make(chan int)  // c has type: chan int


([code for: Basics New And Make](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/059-basics-new-and-make))

## Struktury

A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-blank field names must be unique.



([code for: Basics Structs Defining](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/060-basics-structs-defining))

## Struktury - Kompoozycja

Kompozycja taki pattern chyba znacie ?



([code for: Basics Struct Composition](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/062-basics-struct-composition))

## Struct tags (annotations like)

A tag for a field allows you to attach meta-information to the field which can be acquired using reflection. Usually it is used to provide transformation info on how a struct field is encoded to or decoded from another format (or stored/retrieved from a database), but you can use it to store whatever meta-info you want to, either intended for another package or for your own use.



([code for: Basics Struct Tags](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/064-basics-struct-tags))

## Basics Anonymous Structs



There is no README.md for Basics Anonymous Structs use ([code for: Basics Anonymous Structs](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/065-basics-anonymous-structs)) link to follow code examples



## Interface'y

Go have "implicit interfaces". To implement an interface in Go, we
just need to implement all the methods in the interface.

So what is an interface? An interface is two things: it is a set of
methods, but it is also a type.

### The `interface{}` type

The `interface{}` type, the empty interface, is the source of much
confusion. The interface{} type is the interface that has no
methods. Since there is no implements keyword, all types implement at
least zero methods, and satisfying an interface is done automatically,
all types satisfy the empty interface. That means that if you write a
function that takes an `interface{}` value as a parameter, you can
supply that function with any value. So this function:

    func DoSomething(v interface{}) {
    // ...
    }

will accept any parameter whatsoever.

### Type assertions

- https://medium.com/golangspec/type-assertions-in-go-e609759c42e1



([code for: Basics Interfaces](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/065-basics-interfaces))

## Error handling

There is no exceptions in Go, errors are returned by value, or aggregated in intermediate objects. In go error is simply value which should be handled programatically as quick as possible.

Sources:
- https://blog.golang.org/errors-are-values
- http://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go
- http://davidnix.io/post/error-handling-in-go/



([code for: Basics Errors](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/067-basics-errors))

## Panics

- Used when we want to stop the program.
- We can check if there was a `panic` occurence in function defer chain



([code for: Basics Panics](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/068-basics-panics))

## Strings

In Go, a string is in effect a **read-only slice of bytes**.

It's important to state right up front that a string holds arbitrary bytes. It is not required to hold Unicode text, UTF-8 text, or any other predefined format. As far as the content of a string is concerned, it is exactly equivalent to a slice of bytes.

More on https://blog.golang.org/strings



([code for: Basics Strings](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/070-basics-strings))

## Go routines

A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution.

Goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must be synchronized. The sync package provides useful primitives, although you won't need them much in Go as there are other primitives (channels).

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, <-.



([code for: Basics Goroutines](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/080-basics-goroutines))

## Using 3rd parties

In go we can get packages to our $GOPATH with use of `go get` command.


## DEP

```sh
go dep init
```

`dep` is fully-fledged dependency manager. It downloads all dependencies source code to `vendor` directory and then compilator includes those code during compilation process.



([code for: Basics 3rd Party Packages](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/090-basics-3rd-party-packages))

## Basics Pointers



There is no README.md for Basics Pointers use ([code for: Basics Pointers](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/090-basics-pointers)) link to follow code examples



## Other concurrency patterns

You've lerned about channels primitive on previous chapter of this workshops, now it's time to learn about some other ways of creating concurrent programs in go.

We'll be doing some code with:
- data races errors
- atomic counters
- mutexes
- wait groups



([code for: Concurrency Other](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/100-concurrency-other))

## Channels

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, <-.

    ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
    v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
            // assign value to v.

(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.)

Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use:

    eventsChannel := make(chan int)

By default, **sends and receives block until the other side is ready**. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

### Buffered Channels

Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel:

    ch := make(chan int, 100)

Sends to a buffered channel **block only when the buffer is full**. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

### In this workshops you'll learn about:

- channels mechanics
- receiving data from channel
- channels length
- buffers
- channel closing
- generate data with channels
- timers, tickers with channels
- worker pool
- rate limiting with channels
- selecting proper channel stream
- pipeline and fan-in/fan-out patterns

Feel free to browse [channels chapter source code](100-concurrency-channels/)


([code for: Concurrency Channels](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/101-concurrency-channels))

## Date time

Go has very powerful standard library, first and one of awesome library are is Date time.


([code for: Stdlib Date Time](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/110-stdlib-date-time))

## Running commands in shell



([code for: Stdlib Os Processes](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/110-stdlib-os-processes))

## Args and flags

One of important thing when runnein your program is to get some arguments from user.

in Go you can easily get those data using `os.Args` slice or more powerful package `flags`.

Additionally you can get environment variables from `os.Getenv` function in `os` package


([code for: Stdlib Args](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/114-stdlib-args))

# Streams

Streams in go are very powerful feature, very large part of standard library is written as some kind of stream reader or stream writer.

Go have two basic interfaces shaping all world of data streams `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`.

In this section of workhops we'll try to cover some of use cases for each of them.



([code for: Stdlib Streams](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/115-stdlib-streams))

## Basic IO operations

- `bufio` examples
- directory traversal
- merging files with use of `buffers`



([code for: Stdlib Io](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/116-stdlib-io))

## Stdlib Logging package

Go has basic logging package to log what's happening in your program.


([code for: Stdlib Logging](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/120-stdlib-logging))

## HTTP library

Package http provides HTTP client and server implementations.

HTTP is one of fundamental lib in programming. Go has implemented very powerful HTTP primitives which allows creation of full-fledged HTTP powered servers.

Info: there is no routing in stdlib so you need to implement your own or use third party libraries (Gorilla mux, Gin, Echo are ones who can help you)



([code for: Stdlib Http](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/140-stdlib-http))

## HTTP Middlewares

Go is using the term `middleware`, but each language/framework calls the concept differently. `NodeJS` and `Rails` calls it `middleware`. In the `Java EE` (i.e. Java Servlet), it’s called `filters`. `C#` calls it `delegate handlers`.

Essentially, the middleware **performs some specific function** on the HTTP request or response **at a specific stage in the HTTP pipeline** before or after the user defined controller. Middleware is a design pattern to eloquently add cross cutting concerns like logging, handling authentication, or gzip compression without having many code contact points.



([code for: Stdlib Http Middlewares](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/141-stdlib-http-middlewares))

There is no README.md for Stdlib Encoding Xml use ([code for: Stdlib Encoding Xml](https://github.com/exu/go-workshops/tree/master/151-stdlib-encoding-xml)) link to follow code examples



## Templates

In programming we need often some meta templates who help us with interoperability between our code and many output formats. One example could be template engine for generating HTML files for web sites.

In Go there are template engines (yes plural!) implemented in `stdlib`!

We'll go in this chapter by some `html` and `text` template engines.

# MongoDB examples

to use this examples you'll need to run MongoDB server. you can do this using prepared docker-compose file.

```sh
cd docker/mongo
docker-compose up
mongo localhost:7702
```

# RethinkDB

Why rethink here? I think it'll be worth to point out one of it's nice feature - collection changes.

#@ Dockerizing

### run rethink db as container

```
docker run --name some-rethink -v "$PWD:/data" -d rethinkdb
```

mozemy również zmapować porty do lokalnej maszynki

```
docker run --name rethink -p 28015:28015 -v "$PWD/data:/data" -d rethinkdb
```

wtedy instacja kontenera będzie widoczna pod adresem `localhost:28015`

# Kubernetes deployment on local machine

We'll try now put our code in working Kubernetes cluster with use of Kubernetes and Minikube on our local machine.

Kubernetes looks great but doing quick developemnt flow could be plain in the ass, if you don't have access to infrastructure of AWS or GCE with prepared pipelines to pass your code to valid infrastructure.

What if we want do develop our containers on local machine? I did'n found the out-of-the box solution but there is quite nice workaround for managing your own registry in [Sharing a local registry with minikube](https://blog.hasura.io/sharing-a-local-registry-for-minikube-37c7240d0615) article.


## Getting started

0. Install kubectl and minikube
1. using docker registry runned on minikube cluster + proxy
     ([source](https://blog.hasura.io/sharing-a-local-registry-for-minikube-37c7240d0615))

            ❯ kubectl create -f kubernetes/kube-registry.yaml

            # forwarding ports is temporary
            ❯ kubectl port-forward --namespace kube-system \
            $(kubectl get po -n kube-system | grep kube-registry-v0 | \
            awk '{print $1;}') 5000:5000


3. Now it's time to build our app. New docker have ability to build multi-stage builds.

    We don't need go in our system, this two step build docker will build binary in one step and put it in second step in small container without dependency.


            ❯ docker build -t localhost:5000/goapp:latest .
            ❯ docker push localhost:5000/goapp

    Our app is now ready to go in our local registry (on our cluster).

4. Now it's time to deploy! We'll use declarative method of managing kubernetes cluster with use of yml files.

    First step: create deployment (i've created file `deployment.yml` in `kubernetes` directory):

    ```yml
        apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        name: goapp-deployment
        spec:
        selector:
            matchLabels:
            app: goapp
        replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
        template: # create pods using pod definition in this template
            metadata:
            labels:
                app: goapp
            spec:
            containers:
            - name: goapp
                image: localhost:5000/goapp:latest
                ports:
                - containerPort: 8080
    ```

    I've used `NodePort` method for exposing

    Now if our deployment is prepared (image: from our local repository), we're ready do sync our definition with kubernetes cluster:

        ❯ kubectl create -f kubernetes/deployment.yml


## Play a little with our cluster

    our deployment is ready, we can play a little with it.

    - get pods:

            ❯ kubectl get pods -l app=goapp

            NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
            goapp-deployment-684d96ff7-27hct   1/1       Running   0          1h
            goapp-deployment-684d96ff7-ltl7h   1/1       Running   0          1h

    - get deployments

            ❯  kubectl get deployments -l app=goapp
            NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
            goapp-deployment   2         2         2            2           1h

    - exec something on pod

            ❯ kubectl exec -it goapp-deployment-684d96ff7-27hct sh
            /app # ps aux
            PID   USER     TIME   COMMAND
                1 root       0:00 /bin/sh -c ./goapp
                5 root       0:00 ./goapp
            61 root       0:00 sh
            65 root       0:00 ps aux
            /app #

        Yeah! there is my goapp running, but **its network is exposed only inside Kubernetes cluster**. Now it's time to expose it outside cluster.

    - expose as Service (`NodePort`) - use mapping of some port on cluster node to external cluster ip.

        Now create our service definition file (`kubernetes/servicey.yml`)

        ```yml
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Service
            metadata:
            name: goapp
            labels:
                app: goapp
            spec:
            type: NodePort
            ports:
                - port: 8080
                nodePort: 30080
            selector:
                app: goapp
        ```

        And synchronise our cluster:

            ❯ kubectl create -f kubernetes/service.yml

        After that we can check if our service is created correctly:

            ❯ kubectl get service goapp
            NAME      TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
            goapp     NodePort   10.106.164.215   <none>        8080:30080/TCP   26m

        `30080` is our port which will be visible outside cluster


        Next we need to get somehow ip address of kubernetes cluster. I'm using minikube so it's quite simple

            ❯ minikube ip
            # we assign to env variable
            ❯ IP=$(minikube ip)


        When we have external cluster IP now we can access our service on given port.

            ❯ IP=$(minikube ip)
            ❯ curl $IP:30080
            Hello World! 2018-03-19 19:15:47.543450202 +0000 UTC from goapp-deployment-684d96ff7-ltl7h

        Yeah it's working.

## Profilowanie

### Command

Profilowanie standardowego programu

```
import (
	"runtime/pprof"
)

var cpuprofile = flag.String("cpuprofile", "", "write cpu profile to file")

func init() {
	flag.Parse()
	if *cpuprofile != "" {
		f, err := os.Create(*cpuprofile)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		pprof.StartCPUProfile(f)
	}
}

func main() {
	defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()

```


Następnie budujemy binarkę i odpalamy ją z flagą cpuprofile

```
go build command.go && ./command -cpuprofile=data.prof
```

po czym możemy włączyć nasz profiler

```
go tool pprof command data.prof
```

Możemy do naszego programu dodać memory profile

```
var memprofile = flag.String("memprofile", "", "write memory profile to this file")


func memProfile() {
	if *memprofile != "" {
		f, err := os.Create(*memprofile)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		pprof.WriteHeapProfile(f)
		f.Close()
		return
	}
}
```

informacje o pamięci zbierane są zbierane na końcu więc dorzucamy do defer list
```
func main() {
    defer memProfile()

```

Teraz możemy zbierać informacje o obu profilach

```
go build command.go && ./command -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -memprofile=mem.prof

go tool pprof command cpu.prof

go tool pprof command mem.prof
```


### Web

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	_ "net/http/pprof"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	for i := 0; i < 100000000; i++ {
		w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d - %d, ", i, i)))
	}
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

```


run in shell:

```
go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile
```
